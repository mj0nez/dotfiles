# Flatpak

The nextcloud-clients are either pretty old or do not function when installing from source.
Therefore the official but not verified flatpak app is used:

https://flathub.org/apps/com.nextcloud.desktopclient.nextcloud

> **NOTE**: Don't forget to add an autostart entry for `/usr/bin/flatpak run com.nextcloud.desktopclient.nextcloud`
